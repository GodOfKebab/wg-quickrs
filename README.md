# wg-rusteze

⚠️ This repo is a **work in progress**!

An intuitive and feature-rich WireGuard configuration management tool written mainly in Rust.

This project aims to replace wg-enhance, which I forked from wg-easy by Emile Nijssen.

TODO:

1. [x] ~~Set up the hello world for Vue + Actix~~
2. [ ] Use a .json file for persistent configuration store.
3. [ ] Generate .conf file from configurations (in a format wg-quick accepts).
4. [ ] Implement the API endpoints for getting/configuring and create postman collections.
5. [ ] Use and embed the (userspace) wireguard-go/wg-quick executable into the project and 
update the configuration in each startup/config change.
6. [ ] Write a web frontend in Vue similar to wg-enhanced.
