  # Bruno Collection for `wg-quickrs`
  
  This collection contains a convenient way to check the API endpoints are working correctly when developing.
  
  When every endpoint is run sequentially from top-to-bottom ('happy-path'), all should run successfully if the `password` and `base-url` environment variable is set correctly.
  
  Some notes about endpoints:
  - POST /api/token
    - saves the token to a variable so it can be accessed from other endpoints. So when running the collection, make sure you run this before any other endpoint so you have the correct token
  - GET /api/version
    - password-protected
  - GET /api/network/summary
    - password-protected
  - GET /api/network/lease/address
    - password-protected
  - PATCH /api/network/config
    - password-protected
  - POST /api/wireguard/status
    - `status` values correspond to `WireGuardStatus` Enum
    - 0: invalid
    - 1: disable
    - 2: enable
