# wg-quickrs command line interface

You can also use the command line interface to manage the config.
To get documentation, just pass in `--help` option.

The `installer.sh` script should also install the autocomplete scripts for bash or zsh.

⚠️ Note: If you want to edit config options, you need to stop the agent first. Otherwise, the changes will be overwritten/ignored by the agent.
